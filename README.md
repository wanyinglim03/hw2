This is our hw 2.

We will expand the business website that you created in the first homework, adding styling using the Tailwind CSS framework. In addition, I'll add a form to add user interactivity to my website. The form can be for any purpose that makes sense in the context of what you're building â€“ contact form, order form, survey, etc. Finally, I'll host your site on the Internet using Netlify and accept public form submissions.
